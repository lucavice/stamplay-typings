# stamplay-typings
A repository for Stamplay Type Definition Files (.d.ts) to support TypeScript's strong typings and provide intellisense in plain javascript

# Instructions
1) Download folder 'stamplay-typings'.

2) Include a triple slash reference to the .d.ts file stamplay-sdk.d.ts in your TypeScript or plain javascript file :

    `/// <reference path="stamplay-typings/stamplay-sdk.d.ts" />`

3) If using TypeScript, import the ambient module with `import * as Stamplay from "Stamplay";`

4) Enjoy strong typing and intellisense (only tested in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
